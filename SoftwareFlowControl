Ctrl-s
- Stops data being transmitted to the terminal until you press ctrl-q

( originates from when you might pause transmission to printer )


Disabling ctrl-v 
 - removing the ctrl-v field


Fixing ctrl-m
 - Terminal translates any carriage returns (13, '/r') into 10
 CTRL-j already produces (10), so does the ENTER key.
 Terminal is translating carriage return (/r) into newline (10, /n) 

 -----------------------
 Turning off Output processing
- The terminal is also translating characters in the output processing. ( e.g. - \n become \r\n)
